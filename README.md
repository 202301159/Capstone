This is the C++ program which deletes the Redundant files, files with size ZERO, files which are older than N months, and lastly files which are accessed less than M times.
We will take input file in .txt format
In which our input file.txt contains file name, Date of Creation, Size of file, and number of times the files is accessed.
We removes the file from the input file.txt which does not match the user criteria.
In this problem, we also gave output to the console about the reason why those files were deleted.
